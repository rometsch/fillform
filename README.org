#+title: Automagically fill PDF forms
#+author: Thomas Rometsch

* Description

This script uses *pymupdf* and *pdfrw* to fill a pdf form with information given in a textfile.
For recurring paperwork this can be a huge time saver, especially if the forms contain redundant information.

* Getting started

1) Run =./fill.py --enumerate {your form}.pdf= to produce a copy of the form in which an integer id is entered in to all text fields and checkboxes of the form.
2) Open ={your form}_numbered.pdf= for a reference of the available fields and their ids.
3) Make text file in which you specify your data like follows:

#+begin_example
# you can indicate comments with a '#' character

# you can also leave lines empty
# Now we input data with the syntax:
# {name to remember (not used)}     {field id}    {value .... (rest of the line also including whitespaces)}
FirstField         1     some data
SomeOtherField     42    2.8e7
#+end_example

4) finally run =./fill.py --input {your input textfile} {your form}.pdf= to produce the filled form with a default filename ={your form}_filled.pdf=. Adjust the filename with the =--outfile= option.
